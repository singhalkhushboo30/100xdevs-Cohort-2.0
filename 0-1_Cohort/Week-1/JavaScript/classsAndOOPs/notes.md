# javascript and classes

Yes, JavaScript does have classes. The class syntax was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more familiar and convenient way to work with object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. While JavaScript's classes are often referred to as "syntactic sugar" over the existing prototype-based inheritance system, they do bring a more structured and class-based syntax to the language.

In simpler terms, a prototype-based language is a programming language where objects can be created by cloning existing objects, and these new objects inherit properties and behaviors from the objects they are cloned from. In such languages, there's no strict distinction between classes and instances; instead, objects can serve as prototypes for creating new objects.
