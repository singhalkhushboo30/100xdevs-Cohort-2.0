NPM VS Node.js Vs Express

=> Express is built on top of Node, so yes, Express adds more features while building apps. Node is just a Javascript environment with libraries to make it easy to write software, whereas Express extends Node specifically to add middleware, routing, and much more.

 Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side applications, while npm is a package manager (dependencies required for js code)that helps in managing and sharing reusable JavaScript code. They have different main functions and usage, but they are often used together in web development projects.
